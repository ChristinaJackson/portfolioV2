        I am a JavaScript developer with a strong focus on design, web accessibility and JAMstack applications. I found software development while working to improve the website for my business. I fell in love with development and haven't looked back. </p>

            I love creating solutions to problems, taking deep dives into the how/why things work, and continuously improving my skills. In my spare time you can find me drinking coffee, exploring Oregon, or learning something new.</p>

        <h2>Healing Waters Chiropractic</h2>
            <p>
            "I didn't have a website plan or even know where to begin.  Christina guided me through the creative process and took the time to get to know me to create a website that represented 
            me and my business perfectly! She is very knowledgeable and working with her was a very enjoyable experience. Christina was able to take my feedback and shape and redirect what I was asking for 
            in a productive and realistic way which produced a perfect end result. Not only am I proud of my website but it has helped grow my business very quickly due to the ease at which appointments 
            can be made by the website visitor. She really gave me the best of her knowledge while valuing what I wanted and needed.  Her work is the best investment you can make for your business."
            </p>
    <h2>Water Crisis Project</h2>
        <p>
        "She did an incredible job. I didn’t even know what I wanted for the website but the project is incredibly important to me and I knew I needed to pursue it. I changed my mind 
        several times because I could not narrow down what I wanted. Christina helped to give me a vision to build the website to help others. She was very patient and offered solutions to 
        every issue along the way. We now have a platform to help the people in Flint because of Christina’s work. I would recommend her services to my family and colleagues."

                    <h2>The Why:</h2>
                    <p>
                    The current image is of the project after I did some redesign work, original version can be seen in the above links. I coordinated the original version of this project because I wanted to gain experience developing collaboratively. I reached out to someone who
                    I thought would be willing to participate and together we decided that we would build a mock store front page. I built the image grid,
                    developed the high contrast mode for color accessibility, applied flex-box layout features to the header and footer as well as designing the footer. My partner implemented and adapted code for the cart from a tutorial and from there I added the filter on the products page as well as the feature to click out of cart area to close cart.

                    <h2>Challenges and things to improve:</h2>
                    <p>The biggest challenge here was also the most fun part of this project. My partner on this project lives in a time zone 10 hours ahead of mine. One of us was working on the 
                    project at all times, which made it go quickly but coordination of tasks was difficult at first. We then used trello to track tasks that needed to be done and grabbed what we wanted to work on that day from the board.

                <div>
                    <h2>The Why:</h2>
                    <p>The owner of Healing Waters Chiropractic wanted a professional website for her Chiropractic practice. She wanted to be able to make small changes 
                        to the site without having deal with editing HTML or CSS. I chose to use Webflow to meet the clients needs. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Tech/features used:</h2>
                    <p>Webflow, HTML/CSS, grid, flexbox</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Challenges and things to improve:</h2>
                    <p>The challenge for this project was learning a platform I had not used before in order to meet client needs. Luckily, the Webflow documentation was
                        easy to navigate and did not slow down the expected speed or progress of the project. For this site I also made sure that it met WCAG guidelines for
                        accessibility. The one challenge here was the client was intent on the color selection so there are some contrast issues that exist. There are plans to
                        add high contrast features to the site once the client is ready.

                </ul>
            <div>
                <h2>The Why:</h2>
                <p>This project was built as a result of being contacted by the Water Crisis Project(WCP). WCP is working to provide residents of Flint, MI with 
                water filters so that they can filter their contaminated water. The client wanted a simple site that they could link on their social media that would
                inform people of their goals and direct donations to the Water Crisis Project gofundme account.

            <div>
                <h2>Tech/features used:</h2>
                <p>HTML/CSS, scrollsnap, progressive enhancement, hosted on Firebase </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Challenges and things to improve:</h2>
                <p>Because the Water Crisis project is a non-profit, they wanted a cheap hosting option so more dollars would be able to go to the people of Flint.
                In order to fulfill this admirable goal I chose to have their site hosted on Firebase which provides free hosting for smaller projects.
